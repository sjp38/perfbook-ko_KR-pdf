Introduction
============

This repository is a git repository for distribution of a PDF file that built
from Korean translation[1] of `Is Parallel Programming Hard, And, If So, What
Can You Do About It?`[2].  Operating a repository for build output with git is
hilarious thinking.  However, there is no available dimain and server for now.
So, just do it for now.


Translation Progress
====================

Whole chapters and appendices of the first edition of the book are translated
('perfbook-1st-edition.pdf'), and we were further wordsmithing it while getting
upstream updates and translating the updates.  Because the second edition is
released, however, we started translating it from the scratch without getting
upstream updates, and stopped the wordsmithing of 1st edition.
