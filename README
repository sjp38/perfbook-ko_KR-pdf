Introduction
============

This repository is a git repository for distribution of a PDF file that built
from Korean translation[1] of `Is Parallel Programming Hard, And, If So, What
Can You Do About It?`[2].  Operating a repository for build output with git is
hilarious thinking.  However, there is no available dimain and server for now.
So, just do it for now.


Translation Progress
====================

Currently we completed the first two editions of the book.

Translation Strategy and Editions
---------------------------------

The upstream community is continuously updating the book.  Once in a while,
they tag a version of the book as an edition.  As of this writing, the upstream
has released two editions.

We translate each edition, from the scratch.  Until the whole parts of the book
is translated, we receive only minimum changes from the upstream.  Once the all
parts of the book is translated, we may (or may not) get more upstream chnges
and translate, while also wordsmithing the translation itself.

The translation is for only technical parts.  Non-technical parts such as
'Credits' chapter, and parts that translation is not required such as
'Bibliography' chapter wouldn't be translated.
