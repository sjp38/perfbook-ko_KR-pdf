Introduction
============

This repository is a git repository for distribution of a PDF file that built
from Korean translation[1] of `Is Parallel Programming Hard, And, If So, What
Can You Do About It?`[2].  Operating a repository for build output with git is
hilarious thinking.  However, there is no available dimain and server for now.
So, just do it for now.
